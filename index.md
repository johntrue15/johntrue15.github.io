## Breaking New Ground in X-ray CT for Museums

Welcome! I’m **[Your Name]**, an X-ray postdoc researcher at the **Florida Museum**, working under the **[NSF NOCTURN](https://www.nsf.gov/)** program. Here, we explore cutting-edge **X-ray Computed Tomography (CT)** imaging techniques and robust security solutions to safeguard museum collections.

### About NSF NOCTURN

The **NSF NOCTURN** initiative drives forward-thinking research at the intersection of **advanced imaging**, **data security**, and **digital preservation**. Our mission is to ensure that museum artifacts, natural history specimens, and cultural treasures remain:

- **Accessible** for researchers, educators, and the public.  
- **Comprehensible** through in-depth imaging and analysis.  
- **Protected** with state-of-the-art security measures.

### Advancing X-ray CT Technology

At the Florida Museum, we harness **X-ray CT scanners** to peer into artifacts and specimens without causing any damage. Whether it’s ancient fossils, delicate insects, or cultural relics, **non-invasive imaging** reveals hidden structures and clues about their origin, composition, and state of preservation.

- **Micro-CT**: Captures high-resolution 3D images of smaller items—like insect wings or tiny fossils—showing every minute detail.  
- **Industrial-Scale CT**: Handles larger artifacts and specimens, enabling us to analyze entire structures.  
- **Data Security & Collaboration**: We utilize encrypted systems and secure data pipelines, ensuring that sensitive information is protected while fostering open collaboration among researchers.

### Why It Matters

1. **Preservation**: Early detection of structural weaknesses or degradation helps conserve priceless items before irreversible damage occurs.  
2. **Accessibility**: Digital 3D models let researchers worldwide investigate museum pieces virtually, broadening participation and reducing handling risks.  
3. **Innovation**: As X-ray CT technology evolves, we refine scanning methods to be faster, safer, and more detailed—benefiting museums and research institutions everywhere.
