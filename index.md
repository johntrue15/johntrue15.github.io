## About NSF NoCTURN
- We are a FAIROS Research Coordination Network. Mirroring NSF’s “10 Big Ideas” of Convergence Research the Non-Clinical Tomography Users Research Network (NoCTURN) will leverage input from a broad community of tomography educators, researchers, and industry stakeholders to propose improvements to data handling that cut across scientific disciplines.
- Our primary goal is to develop practical recommendations that link today’s tomography data with tomorrow’s tomography discoveries. 

## What we’re doing: 
- NoCTURN will achieve this goal by providing a platform to:
  1) **engage the international scientific tomographic community via participant recruitment from imaging facilities, academic departments, and data repositories across the globe;**
  2) **stimulate improvements for imaging datasets that focus on findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse;**
  3) **work directly with private companies that manufacture the hardware and software used by these cutting-edge imaging platforms to standardize data acquisition, handling, and sharing to better reflect the Open Science standards championed by federal funding agencies.**
