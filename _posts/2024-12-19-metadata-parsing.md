## Parsing Metadata Using Raspberry Pi Devices and X-ray Computed Tomography

In modern X-ray computed tomography (CT) facilities, metadata such as patient details, scan parameters, and image acquisition settings are critical for efficient data management and analysis. Leveraging Raspberry Pi devices for decentralized metadata parsing offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for facilities with multiple branches. In this post, we’ll explore how to set up a Raspberry Pi to extract and standardize metadata efficiently.

### **What is Metadata in X-ray CT Scanning?**

Metadata in CT scanning refers to the ancillary data that accompanies imaging files, such as:

- **Patient Information**: Name, ID, date of birth, etc.
- **Scan Parameters**: Slice thickness, radiation dose, scanning protocol.
- **Device and Location Data**: CT machine model, operator ID, facility branch.

This metadata is typically stored in the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format, which is the industry standard for medical imaging.

### **Why Use Raspberry Pi Devices for Parsing Metadata?**

#### Key Advantages:
1. **Affordability**: Raspberry Pi devices are low-cost and widely available.
2. **Portability**: Compact and easy to deploy in resource-constrained environments.
3. **Customizability**: Supports tailored software solutions for parsing specific metadata fields.

#### Common Use Cases:
- Decentralized data collection across multiple branches.
- Integration with legacy X-ray machines that lack built-in metadata extraction capabilities.
- Real-time preprocessing of metadata for upload to centralized servers.

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Metadata Parsing**

#### **1. Setting Up the Raspberry Pi**
1. Purchase a Raspberry Pi 4 or similar model with sufficient RAM (4GB recommended).
2. Install the latest Raspberry Pi OS: [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
3. Ensure Python is installed (usually pre-installed on Raspberry Pi OS).

#### **2. Installing Required Libraries**
To work with DICOM files, install the `pydicom` library:
```bash
pip install pydicom
```

### **3. Connecting to the CT Machine

Connect the Raspberry Pi to the CT machine via:

- **USB**: Use a compatible cable to access file exports.
- **Network Interface**: If the CT machine supports PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) protocols, configure the Raspberry Pi as a PACS client.

### **4. Parsing Metadata

Here’s a Python script example for extracting metadata from a DICOM file:

```python
import pydicom

# Load the DICOM file
file_path = "example.dcm"
dataset = pydicom.dcmread(file_path)

# Extract key metadata fields
patient_id = dataset.PatientID
scan_date = dataset.StudyDate
modality = dataset.Modality
facility = dataset.InstitutionName

# Print extracted metadata
print(f"Patient ID: {patient_id}")
print(f"Scan Date: {scan_date}")
print(f"Modality: {modality}")
print(f"Facility: {facility}")
```

# Saving Extracted Metadata as JSON
Save the extracted metadata as JSON for further processing:


```python
import json

metadata = {
    "PatientID": patient_id,
    "StudyDate": scan_date,
    "Modality": modality,
    "InstitutionName": facility
}

with open("metadata.json", "w") as outfile:
    json.dump(metadata, outfile)
```

### Normalizing the Data and Handling Multiple Files

#### Normalizing the Data
Standardizing the metadata ensures compatibility with centralized storage. Examples of normalization include:
- Formatting dates as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Using consistent key names across all metadata files.

#### Handling Multiple Files
To parse and normalize metadata from multiple DICOM files in a folder, use the following Python script:

```python
import os
import pydicom
import json

# Define the folder containing DICOM files
folder_path = "dicom_files"
all_metadata = []

# Iterate through each file in the folder
for file in os.listdir(folder_path):
    if file.endswith(".dcm"):
        # Read the DICOM file
        dataset = pydicom.dcmread(os.path.join(folder_path, file))
        
        # Extract and normalize metadata
        metadata = {
            "PatientID": dataset.PatientID,
            "StudyDate": dataset.StudyDate.replace(".", "-"),  # Normalize date format
            "Modality": dataset.Modality,
            "InstitutionName": dataset.InstitutionName
        }
        all_metadata.append(metadata)

# Save all metadata to a single JSON file
output_file = "all_metadata.json"
with open(output_file, "w") as outfile:
    json.dump(all_metadata, outfile)

print(f"Metadata successfully saved to {output_file}")
```


### Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Inconsistent Metadata
Metadata fields may vary depending on the CT machine manufacturer. This can result in discrepancies in key names, formats, or missing fields, making it difficult to maintain a consistent data structure.

**Solution**:
- Use machine-specific templates or mapping files to standardize field names and formats.
- Implement automated validation checks to ensure that the metadata adheres to a predefined schema. Tools like Python’s `jsonschema` library can help enforce structure and rules.

#### Challenge 2: Large Data Volumes
Parsing thousands of DICOM files on a Raspberry Pi can lead to performance bottlenecks due to its limited computational resources.

**Solution**:
- Offload intensive processing tasks to a centralized server or cloud service with higher computational power.
- Use Python's `concurrent.futures` or `multiprocessing` libraries to process files in parallel, significantly reducing the processing time.

### What’s Next?

Now that we’ve successfully parsed and normalized the metadata, the next step is to upload it to a centralized repository for secure, versioned storage. In the following blog post, we’ll explore how to automate this process using Raspberry Pi and GitHub Releases.
