# Daily Progress Report - CT Image Processing Pipeline

## Overview
Today's work focused on enhancing the CT image processing pipeline, particularly around 3D mesh handling and setting up the infrastructure for both 2D and 3D image analysis workflows.

There are multiple error handling steps that needed to be built to enable Github Actions to run without failing, and sending me emails until it is fixed....

>media error of the 2D or 3D viewer not loading
>morphosource itself not loading

Then some checks are required:

>if the morphosource data is 2D or 3D so I can properly interact with the viewer.

## Completed Items âœ…
- Verified 3D URL processing functionality with test case (https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000699508?locale=en)
- Implemented artifact saving mechanism for both 2D slices and 3D volumes
- Basic 2D slice processing workflow operational

## In Progress ðŸ”§
### 3D Mesh Processing
Currently debugging the 3D mesh visualization component which is showing a blank screen error.

*Current state of 3D mesh rendering issue*

### Integration with OpenAI
Working on establishing the pipeline to pass processed images to ChatGPT for analysis:

    B --> C[OpenAI Processing]
    C --> D[Text Analysis]
```

## Pending Tasks ðŸ”´
1. 2D Image Processing Pipeline
   - Setup test_2d_screenshot.yml
   - Create test_2d_screenshot_prompt.yml
   - Configure OpenAI integration for 2D analysis

2. Configuration Updates
   - Convert ct_to_text.yml to images_to_text.yml
   - Implement completion triggers for screenshot process
   - Develop release fetching logic

## Architecture Overview

## Next Steps
Priority items for next session:
1. Resolve 3D mesh blank screen error
2. Complete the OpenAI integration for 3D image analysis
3. Begin implementation of 2D pipeline components
