# Setting up GitHub Actions & Repo (Secrets, `.github` Folders, Runtime Workflow)

GitHub Actions has quickly become a go-to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) solution for many developers. With it, you can automate builds, tests, and deployments from within your GitHub repository. In this guide, we’ll walk through:

1. **Setting up your GitHub repository**  
2. **Creating and organizing your `.github` folder**  
3. **Configuring secrets in your repository**  
4. **Writing your first GitHub Actions workflow**  

Let’s dive in!

---

## 1. Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

If you already have a GitHub repository you’d like to automate, you can skip to the next sections. Otherwise, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to GitHub**: Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in or create an account.
2. **Create a new repository**:
   - Click the **+** sign in the top-right corner, then choose **New repository**.
   - Provide a **Repository name**, description (optional), and select a visibility (private or public).
   - Click **Create repository**.

You now have a repository ready to accept GitHub Actions workflows.

---

## 2. Creating and Organizing the `.github` Folder

GitHub Actions workflows live under a special folder named `.github/workflows` in your repository. This folder is where you’ll store the YAML files that define your automated workflows.

1. **Create a `.github/workflows` folder**:
   - You can create folders in GitHub directly on the site or locally in your code editor.
   - The structure should look like this:
     ```
     your-repo/
       ├─ .github/
       │   └─ workflows/
       └─ ...other files
     ```

2. **Why `.github`?**  
   GitHub leverages the `.github` folder for various repository-level configurations, including issue templates, pull request templates, and of course, Actions workflows. Keeping these files in one place helps you stay organized and consistent.

---

## 3. Configuring Secrets in Your Repository

Many workflows require confidential information like API keys, access tokens, or passwords. You should never store these credentials directly in your workflow files. Instead, add them as “Secrets” in your repository settings.

1. **Navigate to your repository**.
2. Click on **Settings** (the gear icon).
3. Choose **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** in the left sidebar.
4. Click **New repository secret**.
5. **Enter a name** for your secret (e.g., `MY_API_KEY`).
6. **Paste your secret value** (the API key or token).
7. Click **Add secret**.

Your secret is now stored securely. You can reference it inside your workflow as an environment variable (e.g., `${{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}`).

---

## 4. Writing Your First GitHub Actions Workflow

Now that your `.github/workflows` folder is set up and you’ve added any necessary secrets, let’s create a simple workflow file. We’ll call this file `ci.yml`, and it will run whenever code is pushed to the repository.

### Example `ci.yml` Workflow

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow is made up of one or more jobs
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    # The type of machine to run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps are actions to run in the job
    steps:
      # Check out the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Install dependencies (Node.js example)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      # Example usage of secrets
      - name: Use secret
        run: echo "My secret is $MY_API_KEY"
        env:
          MY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}
```

## Explaining the Workflow

**name:**  
A friendly name for your workflow that will appear in the GitHub Actions tab.

**on:**  
Specifies the events that trigger the workflow. In this example, the workflow runs on any `push` or `pull_request` to the `main` branch.

**jobs:**  
You can define one or more jobs. Each job can have multiple steps.

**runs-on:**  
Defines the runner (i.e., the operating system and environment) that executes the steps.

**steps:**  
Individual actions or commands that run in sequence.

- `actions/checkout@v3` checks out your repository code.  
- `npm install` and `npm test` show a typical Node.js use case.  
- `echo "My secret is $MY_API_KEY"` demonstrates using a secret as an environment variable.

### Note on Secrets

To use secrets, reference them in your workflow with <code>${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_NAME }}</code>. In this example, `MY_API_KEY` is the name of the secret you configured in your repository.

---

## 5. Testing the Workflow

Once you commit the YAML file to your repository (or merge a pull request with this file in it), GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow based on the triggers you specified.

1. **Go to the Actions tab** in your repository.  
2. Select the workflow (named **CI Workflow** in our example).  
3. Observe the run details in real-time. You’ll see logs for each step as they’re executed.  
4. If something goes wrong, you can check the logs for errors and troubleshoot. Once you fix any issues, push a new commit and watch the workflow run again.

## 6. Tips and Best Practices

- **Use separate workflows for different tasks**: For instance, a build/test workflow separate from a deployment workflow. This keeps them simpler and easier to maintain.  
- **Leverage GitHub Action Marketplace**: Check out the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) for reusable actions created by the community.  
- **Pin versions of actions**: Instead of referencing `actions/checkout@v3`, you could pin to a specific commit SHA. This ensures reproducible builds.  
- **Store tokens, keys, and passwords in Secrets**: Never commit sensitive information directly into your repository.  
- **Use matrix builds**: If you need to test multiple versions of a language or runtime, [matrix builds](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-build-matrix-for-jobs) are extremely handy.

## Conclusion

With your GitHub Actions workflow in place, you’ve taken the first step toward efficient, automated pipelines for your projects. From simple builds and tests to complex, multi-step deployments, GitHub Actions can handle just about anything. Remember to keep secrets safe, modularize your workflows, and explore the GitHub Marketplace for even more possibilities!

**Happy automating!**
