**John True Jr.** earned his PhD in *Electrical and Computer Engineering* at the **University of Florida**, where he focused on the development of X-ray computed tomogrpahy algorithms for extracting design information from electronics. Today, he brings that expertise to the NOCTURN program, spearheading the automation of crucial data processes at the Florida Museum. By integrating cutting-edge software tools and rigorous data models, John is working to ensure that researchers and curators can seamlessly access and manage vast collections of artifacts and specimens.

Outside academia, John is an **avid biker**, exploring Floridaâ€™s lush springs and state parks every chance he gets. He also **dabbles in woodworking**, crafting functional but aesthetically appealing creation from natural woods.
