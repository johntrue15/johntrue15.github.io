# CT to Text: A Newly Published Release

We've just published an exciting new release of our **CT to Text** workflow. This release demonstrates how raw data from *MorphoSource* CT scans can be transformed into readable scientific summaries. By pulling in fresh metadata, the workflow automatically generates multi-paragraph narratives, highlighting each specimen's taxonomy and morphological significance.

## Screenshot of the Release

In the screenshot above, you can see two exemplary entries:

1. **Record #N/A** – Here, minimal metadata was provided for the record, meaning the summary tool wasn't able to generate an in-depth description. This highlights how crucial it is to include detailed specimen information to fully leverage CT scanning insights.

2. **Record #104284** – A complete record showcasing a *Coahomasuchus kahleorum* specimen. This example demonstrates how our pipeline describes a cranial structure, discussing the significance of CT images in revealing neuroanatomical details, jaw mechanics, and potential evolutionary adaptations.

## Why This Matters

CT scanning provides a non-invasive glimpse into internal structures, helping researchers understand how ancient or modern organisms might have functioned and evolved. These auto-generated summaries:

* Aid **quick comprehension** for peers accessing new data
* **Summarize morphological features** and evolutionary insights without needing specialized parsing tools
* Offer a **consistent narrative structure**, making large data sets more approachable for a broad range of scientific audiences

Feel free to explore the release, and consider how a similar workflow could enhance your own repository's data publication process. From quick overviews to deeper morphological insights, the **CT to Text** pipeline is designed to streamline knowledge transfer from raw data to curated summary.
