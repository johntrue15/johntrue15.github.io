## Uploading Metadata to GitHub Releases Using Raspberry Pi Devices

After parsing and normalizing metadata from X-ray computed tomography (CT) machines, the next step is to securely store this information. GitHub Releases is an ideal solution for version-controlled storage, enabling metadata to be easily accessed and shared across distributed facilities.

This blog will walk you through the process of preparing your Raspberry Pi, automating uploads to GitHub, and managing metadata using GitHub Releases.

---

### Why Use GitHub Releases?

GitHub Releases provide a robust solution for:
- **Version Control**: Track changes in metadata over time with clear version tags.
- **Accessibility**: Centralized storage that’s easy to retrieve for downstream applications.
- **Automation**: Integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions for post-upload workflows.

### Setting Up the Raspberry Pi

Before we automate uploads, ensure the Raspberry Pi is ready with the required tools:

#### 1. Install GitHub CLI
GitHub CLI (`gh`) is a powerful tool for interacting with GitHub repositories directly from the command line.

To install it, run:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

### Setting Up GitHub CLI on Raspberry Pi

#### 1. Verify the Installation

After installing GitHub CLI (`gh`), verify the installation to ensure it’s working properly:

```bash
gh --version
```

### 2. Authenticate with GitHub

Authenticate your Raspberry Pi to interact with GitHub:

```bash
gh auth login
```

You’ll be prompted to log in using a web browser or a device code. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create releases in your target repository.

### 3. Preparing Metadata for Upload
Ensure the metadata is saved in a structured format like JSON or CSV. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "PatientID": "12345",
    "StudyDate": "2024-12-25",
    "Modality": "CT",
    "InstitutionName": "Branch A"
  },
  {
    "PatientID": "67890",
    "StudyDate": "2024-12-26",
    "Modality": "CT",
    "InstitutionName": "Branch B"
  }
]
```
Save this file as `metadata.json` for upload.

### 4. Automating the Upload Process
Create a Bash script to automate the release creation and metadata upload.

**Example Script: Upload Metadata to GitHub Releases**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
REPO="your-org/your-repo" # Replace with your GitHub repository
TAG="metadata-$(date +%Y%m%d)" # Generate a unique tag for the release
FILENAME="metadata.json" # Metadata file to upload
DESCRIPTION="Metadata upload for $(date)" # Release description

# Create a new GitHub release and upload the metadata
gh release create "$TAG" "$FILENAME" -R "$REPO" -t "$TAG" -n "$DESCRIPTION"

# Confirm success
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Metadata successfully uploaded to GitHub Release: $TAG"
else
    echo "Error: Failed to upload metadata"
fi
```

### 5. Setting Up the Repository

#### 1. Create a GitHub Repository:

- Log in to GitHub and create a new repository (public or private).
- Clone the repository onto your Raspberry Pi:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
```


#### 2. Enable Releases:

- Go to the "Releases" section of your repository.
- Ensure the repository is configured to allow uploading release assets.
### 6. Testing the Workflow

#### 1. Place your `metadata.json` file in the same directory as the Bash script.
#### 2. Run the script:

``` bash
./upload_metadata.sh
```

#### 3. Verify the release on GitHub:

- Navigate to your repository → Releases → Confirm the new release and the attached metadata.json.

### 7. Benefits of Using GitHub Releases

- **Structured Storage**: Each release is tagged, making it easy to reference specific versions.
- **Built-in Metadata**: Release descriptions and tags provide additional context for uploaded files.
- **Integration Ready**: GitHub Releases integrate with GitHub Actions, enabling automated post-upload tasks.

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Authentication Issues
Users may face issues authenticating the Raspberry Pi to GitHub.

**Solution**:
- Use a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the required permissions.
- Store the PAT securely using environment variables:
  ```bash
  export GH_TOKEN="your-personal-access-token"
  ```

  
#### Challenge 2: Large Metadata Files
Large files can lead to upload failures or timeout errors.

**Solution**:

- Compress the metadata file before upload:
```bash
gzip metadata.json
```

- Split large metadata into smaller files if necessary to meet GitHub’s size limits.


### What’s Next?

With metadata successfully uploaded to GitHub Releases, the next step is to distribute it to external systems or AI models for analysis. In the next post, we’ll explore how to use GitHub Actions to automate this distribution process.
